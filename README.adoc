== Overview

_Sling TG_ is a web framework for managing https://telegram.org/[Telegram] bots. It encapsulates technical interactions with the bots so that the user of the framework needs to implement only the business logic.

== Details
=== Boilerplate Code and Persistence Logic

https://core.telegram.org/bots/api[Telegram Bot API] is complex. To use it, a Telegram bot owner usually needs to develop substantial amount of non-business related code, e.g. for registering the bot and for extracting data from updates. Often that code is repeatable and should be tediously reiterated for each new bot.

Another important aspect of Telegram bot development is persistence of bot's activity. Telegram Bot API is generally stateless. This means that the Telegram bot owner needs to store the bot's activity in an external database and that persistence logic needs to be implemented by the bot owner fully from scratch.

_Sling TG_ addresses both of the mentioned issues. It provides the user of the framework with abstractions that encapsulate in a generic way non-business related code for usage of Telegram Bot API and data persistence. Thanks to that the user of _Sling TG_ needs to implement only the business logic and deliver required bot configurations.

=== Usage Examples
Unit tests show complete examples of using _Sling TG_ framework, including bot configuration, persistence of updates and sending messages.

=== Maven Coordinates
_Sling TG_ coordinates in Maven Central Repository are the following:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>eu.ciechanowiec</groupId>
    <artifactId>sling.rocket.telegram</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----

=== Sling Rocket
_Sling TG_ is based on the https://github.com/ciechanowiec/sling_rocket[Sling Rocket] web framework and can be used exclusively within that framework.

=== Secrets

Unit tests are run against two real Telegram bots and require passing secrets of those bots as system properties: `sling.firstBotToken`, `sling.secondBotToken` and `sling.chatID`. Among others, this can be done as follows:

[source,bash]
....
mvn clean install \
    -Dsling.firstBotToken=HIDDEN_TOKEN \
    -Dsling.secondBotToken=HIDDEN_TOKEN \
    -Dsling.chatID=1214316050
....
